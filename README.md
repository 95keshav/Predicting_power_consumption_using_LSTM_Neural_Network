<h1 align="center">Forecasting Power Consumption of house with LTSM deep Neural Network</h1>

<br>

## :dart: About ##

Problem is to forecast current hour electricity consumption of a house by using previous hour values for which we will using Long-Term Short Memory Deep Neural Network (LSTM). Above models support multiple variables. For comparing and checking performance we will use RMSE and R2 performance metrices to compare models. The Dataset contains 8 years of hourly electricity demand for a residential building from 2012 to 2018 with one hour time step. The dataset contains multiple variables like air pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and cloud cover at predetermine location. There is total 70080 recordings. The dataset is provided by IEEE.
